# OptionPrices

An exploration to compare and contrast the different kinds of option price modelling strategies on real world data. These models are necessary because many assets are illiquid. As such, their mark to market value does not sufficiently converge on the fair price. 
I want to create and compare 3 common models:
    - binomial model
    - Black-Scholes
    - Monte Carlo

In the future, I can add and compare more models

I want to run them and see their performance on a few different types of underlying assets and in a few different historical contexts
