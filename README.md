# OptionPrices

An exploration to compare and contrast the different kinds of option price modelling strategies on real world data. These models are necessary because many assets are illiquid. As such, their mark to market value does not sufficiently converge on the fair price. 

I want to create and compare 3 common models:
    - binomial model
    - Black-Scholes
    - Monte Carlo
