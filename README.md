# OptionPrices

An exploration to compare and contrast the different kinds of option price modelling strategies on real world data.
I want to create and compare 3 common models:
    - binomial model
    - Black-Scholes
    - Monte Carlo

In the future, I can add and compare more models

I want to run them and see their performance on a few different types of underlying assets and in a few different historical contexts
